/**
 * workspace-bundle-contract-v1 (WP4 / F3) — workspace-manifest.json emitter.
 *
 * Writes the bundle descriptor `workspace-manifest.json` (schema
 * `graphify_workspace_manifest_v1`) into the bundle root, alongside the scene
 * + its sidecars. The aclp-am peer consumes the manifest first: it discovers
 * the bundle's artifacts, validates their schema ids, and verifies integrity
 * via the per-artifact sha256 + size_bytes — without out-of-band knowledge of
 * which files a given build emitted.
 *
 * The bundle (per the signed contract's `bundle_artifacts`) is:
 *   - scene                  scene.json                     (OPTIONAL, F1)
 *   - scene-hierarchies      scene-hierarchies.json         (CORE,
 *                            graphify_scene_hierarchies_v1)
 *   - reconciliation-candidates
 *                            reconciliation-candidates.json
 *                            (graphify_ontology_reconciliation_candidates_v1)
 *   - graph                  graph.json                     (canonical graph)
 *   - entities               entities.json                  (entity sidecars)
 *
 * Design (mirrors `scene-hierarchies-emitter.ts`):
 *   - The PURE manifest shape lives in `workspace-manifest.ts`; this module
 *     owns ALL the I/O. It reads the REAL bytes of each candidate artifact
 *     from disk and hands them to the builder, so the recorded sha256/size
 *     describe exactly what is on disk.
 *   - An artifact that is not on disk is recorded as `present: false` (NOT
 *     dropped): the consumer can distinguish "the producer chose not to emit
 *     this" from "this build is malformed".
 *   - Deterministic: two runs over a byte-identical bundle produce a
 *     byte-identical manifest except for `generated_at`. `generated_at` is
 *     overridable for reproducible builds / tests.
 *   - The manifest does NOT list itself (it cannot hash a file that does not
 *     exist yet, and a self-referential hash is meaningless).
