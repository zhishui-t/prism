/**
 * workspace-bundle-contract-v1 (WP4 / F3) — workspace-manifest builder.
 *
 * The aclp-am peer consumes a *bundle* of graphify outputs (the scene plus its
 * ontology / hierarchy sidecars). Until now each artifact was emitted
 * independently and there was no single descriptor letting the consumer
 * discover and validate the bundle as a whole. This module produces that
 * descriptor: `workspace-manifest.json` (schema `graphify_workspace_manifest_v1`).
 *
 * Design constraints (mirrors the signed `workspace-bundle-contract-v1`):
 *   - Pure & deterministic: the builder takes the artifact descriptors and
 *     their bytes; it does no I/O. The emitter (`workspace-manifest-emitter.ts`)
 *     owns the filesystem.
 *   - Additive & honest: every artifact carries an explicit `present` flag and,
 *     when present, a `sha256` content hash + `size_bytes`. A missing artifact
 *     is recorded as `present: false` (NOT silently dropped) so the consumer
 *     can distinguish "not produced" from "I forgot to look".
 *   - Stable ordering: artifacts are sorted by logical `name` so two builds of
 *     the same bundle produce a byte-identical manifest (modulo `generated_at`).
 *   - Schema-pinned: each artifact records the schema id it claims to satisfy,
 *     so the consumer can refuse a bundle whose schema it does not understand.
 *
 * The manifest is a *discovery + integrity* descriptor, not a replacement for
 * any artifact. It carries no graph data of its own.

 * contract id lets the consumer assert WHICH bundle shape it is reading — the
 * artifact set + the join semantics defined by the contract (join on
 * `registry_record_id`; the scene-hierarchies sidecar is authoritative for
 * traversal). The manifest itself carries only discovery + integrity data; the
